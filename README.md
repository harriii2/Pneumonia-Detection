# PneumoScan AI — Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection

> A production-ready deep learning application that detects **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using a fine-tuned **ResNet-18** model — built with PyTorch and deployed with Streamlit.


## 📌 Overview

PneumoScan AI is an end-to-end machine learning project demonstrating the full pipeline from raw medical imaging data to a working web application. It uses **transfer learning** on a ResNet-18 backbone to classify chest X-rays as **Normal** or **Pneumonia**, achieving ~95% accuracy and ~96% recall on pneumonia cases.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational and research purposes only. It is **not a certified medical device** and must not replace professional clinical diagnosis.
